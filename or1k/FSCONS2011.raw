== Programme ==

The following was the programme for the workshop

* Introduction to the architecture, implementations, toolchain and software
* Detailed presentation of
** RTL development (simulation)
** ORPSoC simulation, debugging
* Worked example of
** Instantiating SHA256 core in ORPSoC
** Writing driver software for it in ORPSoC
** Running software tests in RTL simulation on ORPSoC
** Running ORPSoC to evaluate performance improvement between software and hardware SHA256 hashing

== Hardware ==

* ORSoC ORDB2A demonstrated running Linux
